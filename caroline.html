            We both hate cheesy stuff (sometimes) so I don't know why I'm doing this, but I guess half of me just wants to show you how much I appreciate your presence in my life. 
            <p></p>
            I can't remember much with how we first got close or even why, but I do remember us sitting next to each other during LPEP Day 2. We didn't talk to each other though, and it's probably because I'm having one of those awkward moody days and you were..., well I'm still not sure up until now HAHAHA. I remember us going for lunch during the first week, and I guess that's the very first time we've actually had a real conversation. Long intro cut short, it's funny how a random thing turned into this amazing friendship and I know I wouldn't have it any other way because if not, I wouldn't have this amazingly kind, strong, loving, beautiful, understanding and what not girl in my life. In a short period of time, you became one of my constant go-to. You became that person who I could just go to whenever my mind feels cloudy, the person who knew my struggles, the one who knew whenever I'm at the edge, the one who I share my joys and ups to, and a person who I'll never get tired of caring for. 
            <p></p>
            I'm not sure if I've expressed my gratitude enough so I just want to say thank you again. Thank you for always being there for me and thank you for always understanding me. I know I can be tiring to be with as a friend, I get into so much dramas and I'm super sensitive. But regardless of it all, you stayed and still patiently guided me through my struggles and mistakes. Because of you, I found another family in DLSU and another reason to go explore the world. Thank you for always sharing things that you know will help me grow and mature. Thank you for looking out for me like how an older sister would. 
            <p></p>
            I love you. Yieee heartheart.
